# School links that work automatically — cPanel untouched (Cloudflare)

Goal: after a school is approved, its link `https://<slug>.scholaxia.com/`
works by itself. The main site on cPanel/Hostinger stays exactly as it is.

How it works:
- Cloudflare (free plan) manages DNS for scholaxia.com.
- The apex `@` and `www` records keep pointing at cPanel exactly as today
  (DNS-only, gray cloud) — main site unaffected.
- A wildcard `*` record (orange cloud) + a tiny Cloudflare Worker route
  send every school subdomain to the Render backend, which already serves
  the branded student app at `/school/<slug>/`.

Per-school steps after this one-time setup: **none.** Approve the school
and its link is live.

## One-time setup (~15 minutes)

### 1. Add the domain to Cloudflare (free)
1. Sign up / log in at dash.cloudflare.com → **Add a site** → `scholaxia.com` → Free plan.
2. Cloudflare scans your existing records. It should show:
   - `A · @ · 163.61.188.7` and `A · www · 163.61.188.7` (your cPanel site)
   - `A · surelix · 163.61.188.7`
   - any MX records (leave everything as imported).
3. Make sure `@`, `www`, `surelix`, and all mail records are **DNS only**
   (gray cloud) — only the new `*` record will be proxied (orange).
4. Hostinger → Domains → scholaxia.com → **Nameservers** → change to
   Cloudflare's two nameservers (Cloudflare shows them at the end of
   onboarding). DNS records themselves don't change — the site keeps
   working immediately.

### 2. Add the wildcard record
In Cloudflare → DNS → Add record:
- Type: `CNAME` · Name: `*` · Target: `scholaxia1.onrender.com`
- **Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud)** ← required for the Worker route
- TTL: Auto

(If you already added `*` in Hostinger, delete it there — Cloudflare now
serves the zone. Keep Hostinger's `@`, `www`, `surelix`, MX records so the
import matches.)

### 3. Create the Worker
1. Cloudflare Dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Create → Worker** → name it
   `school-links` → Deploy.
2. Edit code → paste `deploy/cloudflare-school-worker.js` → Deploy.
3. Worker → **Settings → Domains & Routes → Add → Route**:
   - Zone: `scholaxia.com`
   - Route: `*.scholaxia.com/*`
4. Done. `https://divine-light.scholaxia.com/` now serves the
   Divine-Light-branded student login, and so will every future school.

## Notes
- TLS for school subdomains comes from Cloudflare's free Universal SSL
  wildcard — no per-school certificates to manage.
- Keep Hostinger as the registrar; only nameservers move.
- The `/school/<slug>/` links on Render keep working as a fallback.
- If a slug doesn't exist or isn't approved, the backend returns the
  friendly "School not found" page (already built).
- Free plan limits are far above what school traffic needs; if the site
  grows, Workers paid tier is $5/mo.
